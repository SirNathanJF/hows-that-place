## Installation

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the repo from your github
3. Install NPM packages
  ```npm install```
5. Make sure to create a .env file using the .env.EXAMPLE as the boiler plate
6. ```npm run develop``` will start the server. Please visit localhost:3000 in order to view the webpage/game visually. The GraphQL Playground and api can be accesed via localhost:3001. Please feel free to change the port number if this would conflict with any personal items running locally on your machine. 

## Inspiration

My inspiration was from my wife! We both love to travel, and having a nice, clean, and simple to use application where we could see where other people have gone and their reviews would be very nice! I decided to put my development skills to the test and make this application solo. 

## Future Development
```
A user page that displays all pins they have placed
A way to comment on someone elses pins and ask questions, or let them know their review was helpful
A chat/mail system for users to contact each other directly
```
